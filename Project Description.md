# Dealership-Profitability
Our project aims to revolutionize dealership profitability by strategically enhancing after-sales service revenue. Focused on optimizing parts and oil consumption, as well as service charges, our approach centers on delivering unparalleled service quality to customers. We intend to introduce innovative service types, such as express service and pickup/drop services, to further elevate customer experience.

As a data engineer, my analysis delves into key factors influencing after-sales success:

CCE Utilization: We will scrutinize the utilization of Customer Care Executives to streamline customer interactions, ensuring efficient query resolution and service booking.

Employee Engagement: Boosting staff morale and commitment is pivotal. We will implement data-driven strategies to enhance employee engagement, leading to improved service delivery.

Workshop Capacity: Optimizing workshop capacity is crucial for timely service. Our analysis will identify and rectify bottlenecks, ensuring maximum efficiency.

Additional Demanded Repairs: By analyzing customer demands for supplementary repairs, we can tailor service packages to meet unique requirements, thereby increasing revenue.

Volume of Engine Repair: Understanding the engine repair landscape allows for targeted improvements in service protocols, reducing turnaround time and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Carry Forward Ratio: Minimizing carry forward issues is paramount. Our data-driven insights will identify areas for improvement, ensuring that tasks are completed promptly, reducing operational delays.

This comprehensive approach aims to position the dealership as a customer-centric hub, fostering loyalty and driving sustained profitability through enhanced after-sales services.
